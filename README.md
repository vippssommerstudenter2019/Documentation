# Best practices

## Branching

Never push directly to master. When implementing feature X, use the following workflow:
1. Create a branch from dev called feature/X or bug/X or whatever is appropriate for the kind of issue.
2. When the feature is finished (and working properly, not crashing, tested etc.), merge dev into your branch and solve any merge conflicts that may arise.
3. When conflicts are solved, push your branch and create a pull request into dev. Complete the merge, or have someone review it if necessary.
3. After merging your changes into dev, and ensuring that they are indeed working, merge into master and deploy. 

## Commit messages

Informative commit messages are important. 

Describe your changes in imperative mood, e.g. "make xyzzy do frotz" instead of "[This patch] makes xyzzy do frotz" or "[I] changed xyzzy to do frotz", as if you are giving orders to the codebase to change its behavior.

Avoid vague messages like "bugfix" or "finally fucking fixed it" as they require the reader to look at the files to determine the changes made. Instead use messages that can be read like this: "Checking out this commit will <commit message>". E.g. "Checking out this commit will <change button color on the order page>". 

# Setting up the development server (How to run)

- from project folder type this command to install all the node dependencies
```
npm install
``` 
- to start the server locally run 
```
npm start
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
