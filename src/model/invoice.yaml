            introduction: >
                In order to make API calls to Vipps, you need a valid [access token]. 
                The token is valid for 24 hours.

                        A token is an object which represents the right to perform some operation. 
                        An access token, is a system object representing the subject of access control operations. 
                        All API calls are authenticated and authorized based on the application access token 
                        (JWT bearer token).

            title: Registry washing and customer lookup
            introduction: Before sending an invoice to a customer, it is important to do a customer registry lookup to ensure that the invoice is sent to the right customer. This could either be done by using [Vipps Customer Data Query Service] or other washing systems by your choice.

            title: Get recipient token
            introduction: >
                To submit an invoice, you need both an access token and a [recipient token].

                The first step in the invoice payment process is sending an invoice to the customer. 
                As an ISP you should have recieved an invoice from your partner with a URL and [necessary invoice details].

        checking_status:
            title: ISP checks state of invoice
            introduction: >
                After the invoice is sent, you can check if the [state] has changed from "created" to "pending". 
                This will usually happen within 5 seconds, but during high load, it might take longer. 
                Other states may also occur at this point and this can be seen in the [state machine diagram]. 
                When the status is pending, the invoice is visible for the customer in Vipps.
            endpoints:
                - name: "/invoices/{invoiceId}" 
                  description: >
                    In order to verify the state of an invoice, 
                    e.g. if it has been validated and now is available for recipients, 
                    call this endpoint with the invoice ID.

        customer_confirms:
            title: Customer approves
            introduction: >
                As the state has gone from created to pending, the customer will now be notified and the invoice will appear in the customers Vipps app. The customer confirms the invoice and the status changes from pending to approved. If the customer wants to open the attached invoice pdf. before confirming, the IPP/invoice hotel need to perform a [validation] of the JSON Web Token included in the URL. This is to secure that the customer only access the given invoice. 
                Note that after due date it is useful to know if the invoice was confirmed by the customer. This is easily done by checking the status once again.

            introduction: The payment is fulfilled when the customers bank is transferring money to the issuers bank. This happens at the date specified by the customer. Neither Vipps or the ISP is included in this step or is given any further information about the result of the payment.

                If something is wrong with the invoice, 
                you should be able to revoke so that the customer no longer sees it. 
                Note that invoices can be revoked if they currently are in the states created, pending or rejected. 
                If an invoice has been approved, deleted or expired it cannot be revoked anymore.
