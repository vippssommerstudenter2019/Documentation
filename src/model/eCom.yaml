            introduction: >
                To let Vipps send and receive information from you, 
                you need to implement [endpoints] at your [backend]. 
                They make it possible for you to for example get transaction updates and provide shipping details.
            endpoints:
                - name: "[callbackPrefix]/v2/payments/{orderId}"
                  mode: POST
                  description: >
                    Gets called when there is an transaction update for an order. 
                    The callback prefix is the endpoint at your backend where Vipps will send this information to. 
                    You have to check this for updates during the payment process, we'll guide you through it.

                    A way for you to provide shipping details for your orders. 
                    The shipping details prefix is the endpoint at your backend 
                    where Vipps can get shipping details for a given order. 
                    The header will inlcude the order ID.
                  
                 
                - name: "[consentRemovalPrefix]/v2/consents/{userId}"
                  mode: DELETE
                  description: >
                    If the user has notifed Vipps that they want their personal information removed from your site, 
                    their data has to be deleted permanently according to GDPR. 
                    The consent removal prefix is the endpoint at your backend where Vipps will issue this request.
