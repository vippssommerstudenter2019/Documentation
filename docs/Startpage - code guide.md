# Startpage - Code guide

This guide describes how the code is structured for the «startpage» section of the documentation. 

## The components

The code for the startpage is inside the startpage folder. Inside startpage.js, a DocCard constant is written in React and HTML describing the layout for all the documentation cards. Changing, adding or removing a card is easily done by changing, adding or removing the DocCard HTML elements inside const StartPage. 

## Styling

The startpage has its own css file named startpage.module.css. All the startpage styling is written here.
